		<h3><span class="w3-badge font-bold w3-orange" style="font-size: 1.5em;">Why</span>&nbsp;enter my information to lower my cable rate?</h3>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">We have built this site because we
			dislike spending money we don't have to. We also value transparency and dislike the way
			cable companies treat their customers. They are constantly raising
			rates and making you call them to lower it. We want to make this
			process easier for you.</p>
