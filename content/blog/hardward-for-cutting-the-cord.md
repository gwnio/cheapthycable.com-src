Here are the most popular hardware options.

FireTV/Firestick - These are Amazon products so if you are an Amazon Prime member it is a no brainer. However, if you are not a Prime Member don't rule this option out. It is android based so it can run all of the android apps but you may have to sideload some of the apps (like Kodi). You can run all of the major services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, PS Vue, Sling, DirectTV Now, Crackle, WatchESPN, FoxSports, etc. The interface is great. The Firestick is inexpensive at $40 but the FireTV at $80 is much quicker and more responsive.

Roku - This is one of the original streaming devices. It has all of the major services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, PS Vue, Sling, DirectTV Now, Crackle, WatchESPN, FoxSports, etc. It is not android based which means it cannot run Kodi. The interface is not as good as some other devices. There are several lines of varying prices and performances running from $30 to $90. The more higher priced devices have faster processors and more memory.
