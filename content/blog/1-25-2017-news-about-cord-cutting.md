The antenna is making a comeback. I remember my grandparents house that had a motor that rotated the antenna to get the most channels. Antenna technology has improved so much that is not necessary. [In fact you get a better picture with an antenna than with cable.](http://bgr.com/2017/01/22/cord-cutters-antenna-tv-service){:target="_blank"}

[Here is an article](http://dslreports.com/news/138730){:target="_blank"} that reminds me how much I hate cable companies. Charter makes fire victims dig through the rubble in order to avoid a large charge for the equipment.

[As proof that I am not the only one. Charter Communications makes the list of "most hated" companies.](http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/columns/joe-holleman/charter-communications-makes-list-of-most-hated-companies/article_aab8f28e-7836-5da0-872c-77893b3c79e5.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=user-share){:target="_blank"} I think it is a combination of their arrogance and disregard for the customer compounded by their questionable business practices that drives this hatred. Given that cable companies are consolidating I don't see this changing any time soon. There will be less competition for cable services so I believe you will see even more and more cable cutting.
